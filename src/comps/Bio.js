      <p>Ten years experience as a ceramic artist, scientist, educator, and operations manager have honed my innate creative instincts into a
        sharp technical eye, an honest communication style, and a deep delight for the creation and implementation of systems. These skills
        equip me with a unique perspective as a newly minted web developer – one who’s affable and hard-working nature shines brightest
        when part of a team. I am a natural community builder who leads from within by developing and empowering individual team
        members, often through the lens of social justice (e.g. identity, privilege, restorative practices), creating cultures where everyone
        feels valued and wants to contribute.</p>
